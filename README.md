# HeadphoneWumpus
Browser-based version of Hunt The Wumpus, played entirely through one's headphones.

## Gameplay
Eventually, game state will be communicated through audio TTS, and controls will be back, play/pause, and forward media commands, allowing the game to be played blind, with only a pair of headphones and the integrated media controls.

Currently, none of that works. gameplay is through a single line of text displayed on screen, controls use left, down, and right keys instead.

## Generating audio files

Audio files are stored in the audio folder.
New files can be generated by running the audio_gen.sh script, with the help of Festival's "text2wave" program

## Why is this whole thing such a mess right now?

This is my first attempt at javascript, and i'm struggling with elements of the development environment. I don't want to figure out how to trivially host more than one directory on localhost, so all the audio files are in the root. sorry about that. if i don't abandon this project i'll fix that.

some of the audio files seem malformed, they have been replaced with a generic error message until i can solve that issue
