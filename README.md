# AudioWumpus
Browser-based version of Hunt The Wumpus, played entirely through one's headphones.

## Gameplay
Eventually, game state will be communicated through audio TTS, and controls will be back, play/pause, and forward media commands, allowing the game to be played blind, with only a pair of headphones and the integrated media controls.

Currently, none of that works. gameplay is through a single line of text displayed on screen, controls use left, down, and right keys instead.
